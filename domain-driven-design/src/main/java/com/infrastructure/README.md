# Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides technical capabilities that support the other layers.

## Components:
- **config**: Configuration classes for the application and third-party libraries.
- **persistence**: Implementation of repository interfaces (e.g., using JPA, Hibernate, or MongoDB).
- **external**: Clients for external services (e.g., REST clients, message broker adapters).
